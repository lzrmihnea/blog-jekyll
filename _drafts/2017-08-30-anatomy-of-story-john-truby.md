Anatomy of story
# Writing exercise 1 - Creating your premise
1. Premise - write it down in 1 sentence. Ask yourself if it could change your life.
2. Wish list and premise list. Write these down and identify what you care about and enjoy.
3. Possibilities for the premise, write these down.
4. Story challenges and problems. Try to find as many for your idea as possible.
5. Design principle - deeper process or form in which the story will play out in a unique way.
6. Best character - the hero of the story.
7. Conflict - "Who is my hero fighting, what is he fighting about?"
8. Basic action - single cause-and-effect pathway, identifying a basic action the hero will take in the story.
9. Character change - basic action (A) -> go in the opposite way, exploring weaknesses (W) -> his/her change (C) at the end.
10. Moral choice - made at the end of the story. Difficult, but plausible.
11. Audience appeal - is the premise likely to appeal to the audience.

# Seven key steps of Story Structure
1. Weakness and need
- psychological and/or moral, inner
- *a psychological need affects the hero*
- *a moral need affects others*
2. Desire - outer, reported to the outer world
3. Opponent
- competing with the hero for the same goal
- has a special ability to attack the hero's greatest weaknesses
4. Plan
- guidelines, strategies that the hero will use to overcome the opponent and reach the goal or desire.
- shapes the rest of the story, involves many steps
- the hero has to adjust when it fails
- look for the deepest conflict that they can fight over
5. Battle
- in the Godfather, it is a crosscut between Michael's appearance at his nephew's baptism and the killing of the heads of the 5 Mafia families.
6. Self-revelation - comes after the battle.
7. New equilibrium - desire is gone, hero has evolved thanks to the self-revelation.

# Writing exercise 2 - using the 7 steps
1. Story events - describe each story event in a single sentence.
2. Order the event roughly
3. Identify the 7 structure steps

## When creating the hero as well as other characters, connect and compare them to each other!
## All characters connect and define each other in four major ways: by story function, archetype, theme and opposition.

## Each opponent can represent a negative aspect of society/hero.

## For multihero stories, each main character must be put through all seven steps.
- You can make the hero in one storyline the opponent in another one.
- Characters can be connected by being examples/different facades of a single subject or theme.
- Use a cliffhanger at the end of one line to trigger a jump to another line.
- Each human being is unique in an unlimited number of ways, but at the same time human with features we all share. These are shown in action, in space, across time, and compared to others.


## The moment of revelation:
- sudden, for maximum dramatic force for the hero and audience.
- should create a burst of emotion for the hero and audience, as they share the hero's realization.
- should be new information for the hero; he/she should see for the first time that they have been living a lie about themselves which has caused pain both for the hero and those around.
- should trigger the hero to take new moral action, immediately, proving the change caused by the revelation.
## The setup of the revelation:
- hero must be a thinking person, capable of seeing the truth and knowing right action.
- hero must be hiding something from themselves.
- the lie must be hurting the hero in a very real way.

## The opponent:
- love this character
- the opponent holds a key, because the hero learns through his opponent. It is only because the opponent is attacking the hero's greatest weakness, that the hero is forced to deal with it and grow.

# Writing exercise 3 - creating your character
- create the character web, listing them and attributing their functions(hero, main opponent, ally, fake-ally, subplot character).
- central moral problem of the story?
- compare the characters, by the following structural elements:
-- weaknesses
-- need, both psychological and moral
-- desire
-- values
-- power, status, ability
-- how each face the central moral problem
- each character should have a different approach towards the central moral problem
- requirements of a hero:
-- constantly fascinating
-- the audience should identify with the character to a certain extent
-- the audience should empathize (not sympathize) with the hero
-- hero should have a moral and psychological need
- hero's character change: begin with the self-revelation, then go back and determine the starting point of the change, which is the hero's need and/or desire. Then figure out the steps of development in between.
- changed beliefs: write down the beliefs your hero challenges and changes.
- hero's desire: clarify a single goal that extends throughout the story.
- opponents detailed, along with a few values for each opponent.
- minor character should be variations on the hero's weakness and moral problem.
- four-corner opposition. In a 2x2 matrix, list in each cell the main character, main opponent and two secondary opponents. Push the values and traits of each as far away from the other as possible.

## Moral argument: basic strategy
- beliefs and values with which the hero starts.
- moral weakness which causes the hero to hurt those around, unknowingly.
- moral need, based on the moral weakness, which causes the hero to want to be better and act properly towards those around.
- first immoral action, serves as evidence of the weakness.
- desire, the hero comes up with a goal toward which all else is sacrificed, which leads him into conflict with an opponent, with the same goal but different values.
- drive, the hero and opponent advance towards the goal.
- immoral actions. While starting to conflict with the opponent, the hero takes a series of immoral actions out of desperation to win. Other characters should criticize the hero for this.
- attack by ally.
- obsessive drive, galvanized by new revelations. The immoral actions can continue.
- battle, or final conflict.
- moral self-revelation.
- moral decision, between 2 possible actions, which brings him towards the self-revelation.
- thematic revelation, where the theme achieves its greatest impact. It is not limited to the hero, but rather an insight from the audience about how people in general should act and live in the world.
