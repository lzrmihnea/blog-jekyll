Anatomy of story
# Writing exercise 1 - Creating your premise
1. Premise - write it down in 1 sentence. Ask yourself if it could change your life.
2. Wish list and premise list. Write these down and identify what you care about and enjoy.
3. Possibilities for the premise, write these down.
4. Story challenges and problems. Try to find as many for your idea as possible.
5. Design principle - deeper process or form in which the story will play out in a unique way.
6. Best character - the hero of the story.
7. Conflict - "Who is my hero fighting, what is he fighting about?"
8. Basic action - single cause-and-effect pathway, identifying a basic action the hero will take in the story.
9. Character change - basic action (A) -> go in the opposite way, exploring weaknesses (W) -> his/her change (C) at the end.
10. Moral choice - made at the end of the story. Difficult, but plausible.
11. Audience appeal - is the premise likely to appeal to the audience.

# Seven key steps of Story Structure
1. Weakness and need
- psychological and/or moral, inner
- *a psychological need affects the hero*
- *a moral need affects others*
2. Desire - outer, reported to the outer world
3. Opponent
- competing with the hero for the same goal
- has a special ability to attack the hero's greatest weaknesses
4. Plan
- guidelines, strategies that the hero will use to overcome the opponent and reach the goal or desire.
- shapes the rest of the story, involves many steps
- the hero has to adjust when it fails
- look for the deepest conflict that they can fight over 
5. Battle
- in the Godfather, it is a crosscut between Michael's appearance at his nephew's baptism and the killing of the heads of the 5 Mafia families.
6. Self-revelation - comes after the battle.
7. New equilibrium - desire is gone, hero has evolved thanks to the self-revelation.

# Writing exercise 2 - using the 7 steps
1. Story events - describe each story event in a single sentence.
2. Order the event roughly
3. Identify the 7 structure steps

## When creating the hero as well as other characters, connect and compare them to each other!
## All characters connect and define each other in four major ways: by story function, archetype, theme and opposition.
