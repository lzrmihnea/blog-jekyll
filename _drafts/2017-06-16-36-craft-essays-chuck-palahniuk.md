In the course of his writing essays that are meant as a workshop, the author of the cult classic "Fight Club" offers his advice and tips on writing good stories, along with some samples, which he analyzes bit by bit.


# 1. Elements of story arc
## 1.1. Establishing authority: Head vs Heart (showing knowledge vs presenting flaws/embarrassing info about character)
## 1.2 Themes:	Background element of the story (a spooky house, a tournament)
 If you need more freedom, change the character names
## 1.3. 3 types of speech	Descriptive: “The sun rose high”; Instructive: “Walk, don’t run”; Expressive: “Ouch!”
## 1.4. Write the book you want to read; write about the issues that upset you
## 1.5. Write from within some complicated system, job, bureaucracy	Something very everyday until it breaks down to absurdity
	Use illness, drugs or sleep deprivation as devices
## 1.6. Build to the absurd quick, get out fast
## 1.7. If you can let the story/scene surprise you, you can surprise your reader
## 1.8. Writing traps, finding places to write


# 2. Character design
## 2.1 Build a list of interesting facts about your character that you could later evoke
## 2.2. Present a character’s flaws
## 2.3. Money alone is boring, abstract shit, so make it equivalent to a character’s dreams and priorities
## 2.4. A character with nothing left to lose can reveal his deepest desire
## 2.5. fast way to create tension? Hold a character underwater.
## 2.6. Look for lies which people try double-hard to conceal

# 3. Scene setup
## 3.1. Hiding a gun	Buried guns, objects as memory cues
	An insincere promise is a lie is a gun (it’s artificial and manipulative, but it might save you when stuck in a corner)
## 3.2. Bring the listener to any realization a paragraph before the narrator states the fact
## 3.3. A limited number of physical details make up my reality – a smell, a texture, a sound, a nervous tick
## 3.4. If you put an object on a page, use it!
## 3.5. What earlier setups will this scene pay off ?	Know the purpose of each scene or chapter before writing it
 - Ask yourself clearly what earlier questions will this scene answer, and what larger questions will this scene raise
 - You don’t have to know every plot point before you begin writing
## 3.6. If stuck, read an earlier scene, looking for “buried guns”


# 4. Language
## 4.1. Somatic responses from reader
 - unpack the event, moment by moment, smell by smell	keep the narrator aware of the cumulative sensations of his or her body, repeat the sensations and add on top of these	there’s an old method for creating a sympathetic, physical response in the reader: describe either the inside of a character’s mouth or the soles of his feet
 - inject medical language, surgical jargon, anatomy vocabulary, chemical names		
 - with sex, reinvent the language of sex		
## 4.2. Submerging the “I”	“me”, “mine”, “my”		
## 4.3. Unpacking tools	Creating a long description which transmits to the reader the gravity of the information		
## 4.4. Verbs!	The study “sent to me by readers”	Gesture > dialogue. Begin with action	avoid dialogue if you can use gesture, instead
## 4.5. Tell time indirectly			
## 4.6. Establish setting through action; describe the environment as something moves through it, or an action happens in that environment	Describe your world only as some object or person moves through it		
## 4.7. Nervous ticks
## 4.8. Prefer metaphors for comparisons, over similes: “Being married to Jim left shaky as a twelve-year drive down a dirt road”	If you have a comparison, linger on it, overdo it
## 4.9. Erase thought verbs: knew, realized, believed, worried, understood	Erase “like”
## 4.10. your characters can ask questions, and these don’t have to be answered by another character. Your reader knows the answer
