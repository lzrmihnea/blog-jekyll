In the course of his writing essays that are meant as a workshop, the author of the cult classic "Fight Club" offers his advice and tips on writing good stories, along with some samples, which he analyzes bit by bit.


# 1. Elements of story arc
## 1.1. Establishing authority: Head vs Heart
- Head: show knowledge, prove to the reader that the character or narrator is entitled to present the story.
- Heart: present flaws or embarrassing info about the character.
## 1.2 Themes
- Background element of the story: a spooky house, a tournament, an alien invasion.
- Unrelated tip: If you need more freedom, change the character names.
## 1.3. Speeches come in 3 forms:
-	Descriptive: “The sun rose high”;
- Instructive: “Walk, don’t run”;
- Expressive: “Ouch!”
## 1.4. Write the book you want to read;
- Write about the issues that upset you.
## 1.5. Write from within some complicated system, job, bureaucracy
- Write about something very mundane until it breaks down to absurdity.
-	Use illness, drugs or sleep deprivation as devices
## 1.6. Build to the absurd quick, get out fast
## 1.7. If you can let the story/scene surprise you, you can surprise your reader
## 1.8. Writing traps for the writer
- Find controller places to write which confine you to a single space and restrict distractions.


# 2. Character design
## 2.1 Build a list of interesting facts about your character that you could later evoke
## 2.2. Present a character’s flaws
## 2.3. Money alone is boring, abstract shit
- Make money equivalent to a character’s dreams and priorities.
## 2.4. A character with nothing left to lose can reveal his deepest desire
## 2.5. Fast way to create tension? Hold a character underwater.
## 2.6. Look for everyday lies which people try double-hard to conceal

# 3. Scene setup
## 3.1. Hiding or burying a gun
- Use objects as memory cues which can later be evoked and used to move the story further.
- An insincere promise is a lie is a gun (it’s artificial and manipulative, but it might save you when stuck in a corner)
### If you put an object on a page, use it!
## 3.2. Bring the listener to any realization a paragraph before the narrator states the fact
## 3.3. A limited number of physical details make up my reality – a smell, a texture, a sound, a nervous tick
## 3.5. What earlier setups will this scene pay off ?	Know the purpose of each scene or chapter before writing it
 - Ask yourself clearly what earlier questions will this scene answer, and what larger questions will this scene raise.
 - You don’t have to know every plot point before you begin writing.
## 3.6. If stuck, read an earlier scene, looking for “buried guns”


# 4. Language
## 4.1. Somatic responses from reader
 - Unpack the event, moment by moment, smell by smell	keep the narrator aware of the cumulative sensations of his or her body, repeat the sensations and add on top of these.
 - There’s an old method for creating a sympathetic, physical response in the reader: describe either the inside of a character’s mouth or the soles of his feet.
 - Inject medical language, surgical jargon, anatomy vocabulary, chemical names.		
 - With sex, reinvent the language of sex with different wording.		
## 4.2. Submerging the “I”. Instead of it, use “me”, “mine”, “my”
## 4.3. Unpacking tools
- Creating a long description which transmits to the reader the gravity of the information.
## 4.4. Verbs!	The study “sent to me by readers”	Gesture > dialogue. Begin with action	avoid dialogue if you can use gesture, instead
## 4.5. Tell time indirectly			
## 4.6. Establish setting through action; describe the environment as something moves through it, or an action happens in that environment	Describe your world only as some object or person moves through it		
## 4.7. Nervous ticks
## 4.8. Prefer metaphors for comparisons, over similes: “Being married to Jim left shaky as a twelve-year drive down a dirt road”	If you have a comparison, linger on it, overdo it
## 4.9. Erase thought verbs: knew, realized, believed, worried, understood	Erase “like”
## 4.10. your characters can ask questions, and these don’t have to be answered by another character. Your reader knows the answer
