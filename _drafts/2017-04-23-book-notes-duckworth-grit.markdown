Angela Duckworth [ **[website][angela-duckwork-website]{:target="_blank"}** ][ **[wikipedia][angela-duckwork-wikipedia]{:target="_blank"}** ] is a psychologist, popular science author and at the time of writing this article, a Professor of Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.

## 1. Starting point: **Perseverance, or grit > natural born talent and intelligence**

Anyone can have what they want, as long as they're willing to work for it.

## 2. Graduating from top institutions

**West Point US Military Academy: ~14.000 applicants** -> **~960 graduates**

Smaller chance of being enrolled and finishing this academy than some top academies worldwide.

Even though many of the applicants are athletes, physical stamina wasn't a recipe for getting through. Instead, the author applied a grit test, to see which candidates were more determined.
> Half of the questions were about perseverance. They asked how much you agree with statements like “I have overcome setbacks to conquer an important challenge” and “I finish whatever I begin.” The other half of the questions were about passion. They asked whether your “interests change from year to year” and the extent to which you “have been obsessed with a certain idea or project for a short time but later lost interest.” What emerged was the Grit Scale—a test that, when taken honestly, measures the extent to which you approach life with grit.

**Angela also applied the grit scale in a sales company. Six months later...**

> Grit predicted who stayed and who left.

So, although different domains

> when you compare people matched on these characteristics, grit still predicts success. Regardless of specific attributes and advantages that help someone succeed in each of these diverse domains of challenge, grit matters in all of them.

After getting married, **Angela got a job as a math teacher in Lowell High School, from San Francisco**

> Lowell is the only public high school in San Francisco that admits students on the basis of academic merit

> Lowell students were __distinguished more by their work ethic than by their intelligence__. I once asked students in my homeroom how much they studied. The typical answer? Hours and hours. Not in a week, but in a single day.

## 3. Success in the big leagues

On a different place in the spectrum, she documented the business model in **Enron**, a corporate energy giant known for having gone bankrupt.

> Skilling developed a performance review system for Enron that consisted of grading employees annually and summarily firing the bottom 15 percent. In other words, no matter what your absolute level of performance, if you were weak, relative to others, you got fired. Inside Enron, this practice was known as “rank-and-yank.” Skilling considered it one of the most important strategies his company had. But ultimately, it may have contributed to a work environment that rewarded deception and discouraged integrity.

Angela even talked to **Will Smith** about accomplishment

> Accomplishment, in Will’s eyes, is very much about going the distance. Asked to explain his ascendancy to the entertainment elite, Will said: The only thing that I see that is distinctly different about me is: I’m not afraid to die on a treadmill. I will not be outworked, period. You might have more talent than me, you might be smarter than me, you might be sexier than me. You might be all of those things. You got it on me in nine categories. But if we get on the treadmill together, there’s two things: You’re getting off first, or I’m going to die. It’s really that simple.


> “The separation of talent and skill,” Will Smith points out, “is one of the greatest misunderstood concepts for people who are trying to excel, who have dreams, who want to do things. Talent you have naturally. Skill is only developed by hours and hours and hours of beating on your craft.”

And **Woody Allen**

> The prolific writer and director Woody Allen, when asked about his advice for young artists, once said: My observation was that once a person actually completed a play or a novel he was well on his way to getting it produced or published, as opposed to a vast majority of people who tell me their ambition is to write, but who strike out on the very first level and indeed never write the play or book. Or, in Allen’s snappier formulation, “Eighty percent of success in life is showing up.”

## 4. Applying to daily life

# 4.1. The book notes that **success is the accumulation of many small daily tasks put together over a large period of time**.

A great way of getting through these small, tedious, daily

> For instance, getting out the door by eight a.m. is a low-level goal. It only matters because of a mid-level goal: arriving at work on time. Why do you care about that? Because you want to be punctual. Why do you care about that? Because being punctual shows respect for the people with whom you work. Why is that important? Because you strive to be a good leader.

# **When you think in terms of big goals, you start organizing you small daily routines around reaching those big goals.**

> In very gritty people, most mid-level and low-level goals are, in some way or another, related to that ultimate goal. In contrast, a lack of grit can come from having less coherent goal structures.

Take for example **Hall of Fame baseball pitcher [Tom Seaver][tom-seaver-wikipedia]{:target="_blank"}**

> Pitching . . . determines what I eat, when I go to bed, what I do when I’m awake. It determines how I spend my life when I’m not pitching. If it means I have to come to Florida and can’t get tanned because I might get a burn that would keep me from throwing for a few days, then I never go shirtless in the sun. . . . If it means I have to remind myself to pet dogs with my left hand or throw logs on the fire with my left hand, then I do that, too. If it means in the winter I eat cottage cheese instead of chocolate chip cookies in order to keep my weight down, then I eat cottage cheese. The life Seaver described sounds grim. But that’s not how Seaver saw things: “Pitching is what makes me happy. I’ve devoted my life to it. . . . I’ve made up my mind what I want to do. I’m happy when I pitch well so I only do things that help me be happy.”

# 4.2. **Warren Buffet's 3 steps**

4.2.1. Write down a list of **twenty-five career goals**.

4.2.2. **Circle the five highest-priority goals. Just five**.

4.2.3. Take a good hard look at the **twenty goals you didn’t circle. These you avoid at all costs**. They’re what distract you; they eat away time and energy, taking your eye from the goals that matter more.

When compiling this list, some goals might be inadvertently linked to one another

> Then I tried to take Buffett’s advice and circle just a few of the most interesting and important goals, relegating the rest to the avoid-at-all-cost category. I tried, but I just couldn’t do it. After a day or so of wondering who was right—me or Warren Buffett—I realized that a lot of my goals were, in fact, related to one another. The majority, in fact, were means to ends, setting me up to make progress toward one ultimate goal: helping kids achieve and thrive. There were only a few professional goals for which this wasn’t true. Reluctantly, I decided to put those on the avoid-at-all-cost list.


> Now, if I could ever sit down with Buffett and go through my list with him (which is unlikely, since I doubt my needs rate a place in his goal hierarchy), he would surely tell me that the point of this exercise is to face the fact that time and energy are limited.

# **The point of this exercise is to face the fact that time and energy are limited.**

> to Buffett’s three-step exercise in prioritizing, I would add an additional step: Ask yourself, To what extent do these goals serve a common purpose?

# 4.3. Grit is contagious - join a gritty culture

> If you want to be grittier, find a gritty culture and join it. If you’re a leader, and you want the people in your organization to be grittier, create a gritty culture.

> The real way to become a great swimmer is to join a great team.

> “when I started studying Olympians, I thought, ‘What kind of oddball gets up every day at four in the morning to go to swimming practice?’ I thought, ‘These must be extraordinary people to do that sort of thing.’ But the thing is, when you go to a place where basically everybody you know is getting up at four in the morning to go to practice, that’s just what you do. It’s no big deal. It becomes a habit.”


# 4.4. Deliberate practice and setting goals

> This is how experts practice: First, they set a stretch goal, zeroing in on just one narrow aspect of their overall performance. Rather than focus on what they already do well, experts strive to improve specific weaknesses. They intentionally seek out challenges they can’t yet meet. Olympic gold medal swimmer Rowdy Gaines, for example, said, “At every practice, I would try to beat myself. If my coach gave me ten 100s one day and asked me to hold 1:15, then the next day when he gave me ten 100s, I’d try to hold 1:14.”

> But the most important finding was that the type of practice mattered tremendously. **Deliberate practice predicted advancing to further rounds in final competition far better than any other kind of preparation.**

> **The roots of knowledge are bitter, but its fruits are sweet.**

## 4.4.1. Requirements of deliberate practice:

# - **A clearly defined stretch goal**

# - **Full concentration and effort**

# - **Immediate and informative feedback**

# - **Repetition with reflection and refinement**

> asked what advice they’d give to another student on how to succeed in school, students who learned about deliberate practice were more likely to recommend “focus on your weaknesses” and “concentrate one hundred percent.”

## 4.5. Make it a habit.

> Eventually, if you keep practicing in the same time and place, what once took conscious thought to initiate becomes automatic.

> When it’s eight in the morning and I’m in my home office, I will reread yesterday’s draft. This habit didn’t make the writing easier, per se, but it sure made it easier to get started.

## 5. The steps to reaching passion in a goal

> First comes interest. Passion begins with intrinsically enjoying what you do.

> Next comes the capacity to practice. One form of perseverance is the daily discipline of trying to do things better than we did yesterday.

> Third is purpose. What ripens passion is the conviction that your work matters.

> And, finally, hope. Hope is a rising-to-the-occasion kind of perseverance.

# **Job < Carrer < Calling**

> Consider the parable of the bricklayers: Three bricklayers are asked: “What are you doing?” The first says, “I am laying bricks.” The second says, “I am building a church.” And the third says, “I am building the house of God.” The first bricklayer has a job. The second has a career. The third has a calling.

# **Cleaning bathrooms as a calling**

> I confessed to Aurora and Franco that it was hard for me to imagine how cleaning bathrooms—or even building a multimillion-dollar corporation that cleans bathrooms—could feel like a calling. “It’s not about the cleaning,” Aurora explained, her voice tightening with emotion. “It’s about building something. It’s about our clients and solving their problems. Most of all, it’s about the incredible people we employ—they have the biggest souls, and we feel a huge responsibility toward them.”

# **From waitress to manager, just to see if she could do it**

> One time early in Kat’s waitressing days at Hooters, the cooks quit in the middle of their shift. “So,” she told me matter-of-factly, “I went back with the manager and helped cook the food so all the tables got served.” Why? “First of all, I was surviving off tips. That’s how I paid my bills. If people didn’t get their food, they wouldn’t pay their check, and they certainly wouldn’t leave a tip. Second, I was so curious to see if I could do it. And third, I wanted to be helpful.”

## 6. **It's whether you think you can control the pain or not - a mindset experiment on dogs**

> Let me wind back the clock to 1964. Two first-year psychology doctoral students named Marty Seligman and Steve Maier are in a windowless laboratory, watching a caged dog receive electric shocks to its back paws.

> The shocks come randomly and without warning.

> If the dog does nothing, the shock lasts five seconds, but if the dog pushes its nose against a panel at the front of the cage, the shock ends early.

> In a separate cage, another dog is receiving the same shocks at exactly the same intervals, but there’s no panel to push on.

> both dogs get the exact same dosage of shock at the exact same times, but only the first dog is in control of how long each shock lasts.

> The next day, one by one, all the dogs are placed in a different cage called a shuttle box. In the middle, there’s a low wall, just high enough that the dogs can leap the barrier if they try. A high-pitched tone plays, heralding an impending shock, which comes through the floor of the half of the shuttle box where the dog is standing.

> Nearly all the dogs who had control over the shocks the previous day learn to leap the barrier. They hear the tone and jump over the wall to safety.

> In contrast, two-thirds of the dogs who had no control over the shocks the previous day just lie down whimpering, passively waiting for the punishments to stop.

# **It isn’t suffering that leads to hopelessness. It’s suffering you think you can’t control.**

> If you’re a pessimist, you might say, I screw up everything. Or: I’m a loser. These explanations are all permanent; there’s not much you can do to change them. They’re also pervasive; they’re likely to influence lots of life situations, not just your job performance.

> If, on the other hand, you’re an optimist, you might say, I mismanaged my time. Or: I didn’t work efficiently because of distractions. These explanations are all temporary and specific; their “fixability” motivates you to start clearing them away as problems.

# **When you keep searching for ways to change your situation for the better, you stand a chance of finding them**. When you stop searching, assuming they can’t be found, you guarantee they won’t.

Or as Henry Ford is often quoted as saying, **“Whether you think you can, or think you can’t — you’re right.”**

> **"Are you an a MexiCAN or a MexiCAN'T?"** - [Once Upon a Time in Mexico][once-upon-a-time-in-mexico-imdb]{:target="_blank"}

## 7. **Growth mindset**

> I like to think of a growth mindset this way: Some of us believe, deep down, that people really can change. These growth-oriented people assume that it’s possible, for example, to get smarter if you’re given the right opportunities and support and if you try hard enough and if you believe you can do it.

> Praising effort and learning over “natural talent” is an explicit target of teacher training in the KIPP schools. KIPP stands for the Knowledge Is Power Program, and it was started in 1994 by Mike Feinberg and Dave Levin, two gritty young Teach For America teachers. Today, KIPP schools serve seventy thousand elementary, middle, and high school students across the country. The vast majority of KIPPsters, as they proudly refer to themselves, come from low-income families. Against the odds, almost all graduate from high school, and more than 80 percent go on to college.

> So you can’t just talk someone into believing they can master challenges? “That’s right. Just telling somebody they can overcome adversity isn’t enough. For the rewiring to happen, you have to activate the control circuitry at the same time as those low-level areas. That happens when you experience mastery at the same time as adversity.”

## 8. Growing gritty children

In some studies done on American teens, those with warm, respectful, and demanding parents earned higher grades in school, were more self-reliant, suffered from less anxiety and depression, and were less likely to engage in delinquent behavior.

## Overdosing on extracurriculars is rare

> **overdosing on extracurriculars is pretty rare**. These days, the average American teenager reports spending more than three hours a day watching television and playing video games. Additional time is drained away checking social media feeds, texting friends links to cat videos, and tracking the Kardashians as they figure out which outfit to wear—which makes it hard to argue that time can’t be spared for the chess club or the school play, or just about any other structured, skill-focused, adult-guided activity.

> But what about grit? What about accomplishing something that takes years, as opposed to months, of work? If grit is about sticking with a goal for the long-term, and if extracurricular activities are a way of practicing grit, it stands to reason that they’re especially beneficial when we do them for more than a year.

> Research by Harvard political scientist Robert Putnam and his collaborators reveals that affluent American high school students have been participating in extracurricular activities at consistently high rates for the past few decades. In contrast, participation among poor students has been dropping precipitously.

## 9. Final thoughts on developing grit

> Let me close with a few final thoughts. The first is that you can grow your grit. I see two ways to do so. On your own, you can grow your grit “from the inside out”: You can cultivate your interests. You can develop a habit of daily challenge-exceeding-skill practice. You can connect your work to a purpose beyond yourself. And you can learn to hope when all seems lost. You can also grow your grit “from the outside in.” Parents, coaches, teachers, bosses, mentors, friends—developing your personal grit depends critically on other people.

> My second closing thought is about happiness. Success—whether measured by who wins the National Spelling Bee, makes it through West Point, or leads the division in annual sales—is not the only thing you care about. Surely, you also want to be happy. And while happiness and success are related, they’re not identical.

## If we can’t be Einstein, is it worth studying physics?

## If we can’t be Usain Bolt, should we go for a run this morning?

> I’m often asked whether encouraging grit does children a disservice by setting expectations unreasonably high. “Careful, Dr. Duckworth, or children will all grow up thinking they can be Usain Bolt, Wolfgang Mozart, or Albert Einstein.” If we can’t be Einstein, is it worth studying physics? If we can’t be Usain Bolt, should we go for a run this morning? Is there any point in trying to run a little faster or longer than we did yesterday? In my view, these are absurd questions. If my daughter says to me, “Mom, I shouldn’t practice my piano today because I’ll never be Mozart,” I’ll say in reply, “You’re not practicing piano to be Mozart.”

## **You’re not practicing piano to be Mozart.**
